# Group Quiz Plugin for Moodle

## Description
This is an activity plugin that allows a group of students to share a quiz attempt in real-time. It is based on the mod_activequiz plugin's JaveScript functionality that polls quiz data from the server every few seconds. A group of students are able to share quiz attempts. While an attempt is active for their group the students will see the most recent response entered by a groupmate for each question. The students in the group will all receive the same grade for the quiz. The quiz can have a time limit as well as open and close times. Different review options similar to the standard quiz are available on the quiz.

## Requirements
* A grouping of groups must be specified on the activity.

## Installation
* Download the plugin and extract into mod/groupquiz.
