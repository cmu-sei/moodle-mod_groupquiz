update event message text


toggle for open report is not loading at all times

add quizid and attemptid params to the url in view.php so that we can copy/paste it

when grading method changes, we need to regrades by calling process_attempts for each group
remove attempt from params to process_attmepts and just send the group id and quiz id

prevent question edit when attempt is open

track attemptnum and implement max attempts allowed

use js to confirm user choice to submit via popup window showing unanswered questions

remove userid from groupquiz_attempts table

make tables sortable
redirect instructor view of live attempts to view.php with instructor js file

fix spacing on left side of start/continue button

add instructor preview to instructor view tab
add button to add multiple questions from bank onto quiz - not implemented because custom point values are assigned on addition. maybe we just need an instrcutions box so the instructor knows its one at a time
